# Parallel Node Execution

Some changes to what is present on https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph

I use JupyterLab for this example.

### How to Setup

1. Create Python env
```
python3 -m venv venv-langgraph
```
3. Activate env
```
source venv-langgraph/bin/activate
```
4. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run JupyterLab
```
jupyter lab
```

(exit from env)
```
deactivate
```
